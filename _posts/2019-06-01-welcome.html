<p>I recently embarked on a journey of growing my programming, data wrangling, data visualisation and other data science skills.</p>

<p>Over the past few years I've spent a lot of time in the company of some great data scientists from all over the world. 
  I also had the amazing opportunity to share some of the foundational skills that I've acquired, with students, researchers, 
  and other staff members from all South African public universities.</p>

<p>Over the next few years I will be honing my technical skills with the aim of bringing what I learn back to communities and 
  individuals who want to learn and don't know where to start. I will also use these skills for social good wherever and 
  whenever I can.</p>

<p>Here you can read about steps on my journey to grow these skills.</p>

<p>The name "Datascentable" refers to the ascent up the mountain of data-related skills that can be learned to make one more proficient in the world of data science. 
  The -able suffix is to remind me that I can do this - and to remind others that they can do this too!</p>

<p>I hope you will enjoy walking on this journey with me! Please get in touch if my posts aren't clear or if you have questions or comments. See you at the top!</p>
