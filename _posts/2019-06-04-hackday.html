<p>On Saturday 1 June, 2019 I was priviledged to join the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Codebridge/events/261221137/">Hack for Human Rights</a> day that was organised by 
<a href="https://codebridge.org.za/">CODEBRIDGE Newlands</a> and some of their partners.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">CODEBRIDGE</h2>

<p>CODEBRIDGE is an "open community at the intersection of civic-tech and social change". People from the CODEBRIDGE community include
programmers, activists, data analysts, designers, human rights laywers, government officials, journalists, visual artists, storytellers, and more.
The aim of CODEBRIDGE is to encourage the use of civic technology to develop innovative wyas to address societal problems in collaboration
with communities who experience these problems.</p>

<p>Not only is this a great community to get involved in, but I also thought this was a great place to get to practice some of my
data sciency skills on some real-world problems. And... nobody here was going to be too picky about my limited credentials in Data Science as a field.

<h2 class="section-heading">Hack for Human Rights</h2>

<p>There were several projects to get involved in, but I decided to join the <a href="https://metabolismofcities.org">Metabolism of Cities</a>
project pitched by Paul Hoekman. What really attracted me to the project was the thought that Paul and the rest of the team had put
into making the project accessible for others to join and contribute. There are loads of ways to get involved and people with very limited
programming experience will find opportunities there as much as highly experienced developers.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Contributing via Python, Jupyter Notebooks</h2>
<p> Paul created a few tasks on the <a href="https://metabolismofcities.org/community/news/178">Trello board</a> (a light-weight project management tool) that provided a starting point for the 
participants who were new to the Metabolism project. I was immediately drawn to a ticket required a dataset to be downloaded from the
<a href="https://web1.capetown.gov.za/web1/OpenDataPortal/">City of Cape Town Open Data Portal</a>. Over the past few years I've gained some 
experience with open data and I was keen to see what the City of Cape Town has on offer, including looking at the rigour of the data, metadata, data formats and more.

<p>I created a Jupyter Notebook that explains all the steps taken to get from the raw Comma-seperated format file obtained from City of Cape Town
to the data format required for upload into the Metabolism of Cities database. The raw data, Python script (in Jupyter Notebook), as well as the
newly created files are available in my <a href="https://github.com/anelda/metabolism_cities">Github repository</a>. It's a work in 
progress and we'll be making some tweaks to the script over the next few days.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed the vibe at CODEBRIDGE and can highly recommend getting involved in this community if you want to learn, teach, and contribute.
The Metabolism of Cities project is really accessible and welcoming. I'm looking forward to keep on contributing to this project.

<p>Thanks to everyone who made the day a hit!</p>
